# blank -- no day-count condition), OR a dropped_plan lead, OR a
# not_qualified_not_serviceable lead. **[FIX]** -- will_go_later used to
# only count as Nurture past 60 days out from last_follow_up_date; now
# every will_go_later lead counts, unconditionally, same as the other two
# statuses. **[FIX]** -- the third status was misspelled
# "not_qualified_not_servicable" (missing the middle "e"), which never
# matched the real last_follow_up_status value
# ("not_qualified_not_serviceable") -- those leads were silently never
# counted as Nurture. Corrected to match the actual data value.
